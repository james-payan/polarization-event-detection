# Polarization-Based Event Detection on X (Twitter) Data

This repository contains the code and notebooks used to explore **event detection in social media** using a **polarization-based signal** (MEC) and baseline approaches based on **volume** and **sentiment**.

The case study focuses on public debate around the **Colombian pension reform (June–July 2024)** using posts collected from **X (formerly Twitter)**.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to evaluate whether **polarization dynamics** can be used as a reliable signal for detecting relevant events in social media conversations.

## What’s Included

* Data preparation and time-series construction
* Baseline event detection models (volume and sentiment)
* Polarization-based event detection using MEC
* Parameter exploration and comparison of detected events
* Supporting notebooks and experiment outputs

## Repository Structure

* `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experiments
* `data/` – Processed or derived data files (privacy-safe versions only)
* `results/` – Figures, tables, and exported outputs
* `src/` – Helper scripts and reusable functions (if applicable)

## Notes on Data

To respect platform privacy and sharing restrictions, this repository may include only **derived / anonymized data** (e.g., tweet IDs, dates, labels, aggregated signals), not raw tweet text.

This project is released under the **MIT License**. See the `LICENSE` file for details.
